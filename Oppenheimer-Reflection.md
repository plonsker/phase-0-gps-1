Q: What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

A: - Merging branches. 
   - Commits being both ahead and behind master. 
   - The fact that different branches are actually different working directories. 
   - Unstaging and reverting to previous commits. 
   - The difference between typing 'git push/pull/merge/' wihtout adding/specifying
      'origin branch/master'
Q: What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

A: Figured out how to revert to a previous commit. 

Q: What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

A: So many. I asked about the above problems. Also asked about markdown styling.

Q: What still confuses you about git?

A: Most of the above stuff. It was a bit lengthy and tangential and was apropriately reffered to office hours. I haven't yet watched the recording of the office hourse from Fri/10/30. That and some more research should clear things up. 

Q: How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

A: Awesome!
