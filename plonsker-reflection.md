Plonsker's Reflection on GPS 1.1

*What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*
Up to this point, the workflow has made sense to me except for merge conflicts. Often times whenever I carelessly made a change somewhere and didn't track it, my entire process would get derailed and I would have to restart my entire push process all over again. I did not fully understand what a merge conflict was and what I could do to resolve any.

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*
Fortunately, my struggle with merge conflicts was addressed in the GPS. Not only was it clarified through the exercise of Release 5, but also through attempting to fix an actual merge conflict that I had accidentally created. My pair and I walked through the basic steps to correct the issue while also applying a hard reset of the repository on my personal machine. My pair showed me the correct steps for accomplishing the latter by pulling the git commit number from Github, a trick that I did not recall. 

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*
I had some questions regarding basic git work flow that pretty much confirmed I was thinking correctly about the overall system. For my pair, I often asked how they would solve the problem I had run into. I like to ask about the solutions and workarounds others have in mind to see if we are the same page.

*What still confuses you about git?*
While I understand the overall necessity of git, I still don't quite understand why I have to take certain steps in order in git before making a push. I think the more I go through this process though the clearer it will become. 

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*
My first experience was very good. Both my pair and our guide were incredibly helpful and transparent. It proved that education does not happen in a vaccuum, and that you need to collaborate with others to fully understand something you are working on.
